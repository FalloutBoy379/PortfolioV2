    <p class="lead">
        Developed by <strong>Accelo Mobility</strong>, the Beast Truck embodies the company’s mission to drive sustainable transportation. 
        Aimed at replacing traditional tempo vans, the truck offers a payload capacity of <strong>2 tons</strong> with a range of up to 150 kilometers.
        Officially launched in <strong>May 2022</strong>, it attracted interest from companies like <a href="https://delhivery.com" target="_blank">Delhivery</a>.

<!-- Why Choose Accelo? -->
<section class="container my-5">
    <h3>Why Accelo Stood Out</h3>
    <p>
      Working at Accelo Mobility gave me the opportunity to collaborate with a dynamic and driven team that is deeply committed to fostering sustainable transportation solutions. As a company that champions the <strong>‘Make in India’</strong> initiative, Accelo strives to develop cutting-edge technology in-house, reflecting their dedication to innovation and self-reliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accelo’s focus on electrification of the logistics market, particularly last-mile delivery, is aimed at reducing carbon footprints and lowering operational costs for businesses. During my time there, I witnessed the company’s ambitious expansion plans, including the release of around 100 electric vehicles by the end of the year.

      <p>"Accelo reduces operational costs by 30-35% because the vehicles are electric, and maintenance costs are just 1/5th of diesel vehicles."</p>

      <p>"Priced between INR 6.5 lakh to INR 9 lakh, the vehicle will come in multiple variants to serve different use cases. The base model, focused on last-mile delivery, offers a 150 km range with a 15kW motor."</p>
