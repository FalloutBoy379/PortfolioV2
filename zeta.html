        <p class="lead">
          The Zeta 3D Printer is an advanced, high-precision 3D printer capable of producing ultra-fine details using a UV LED projection system. My contributions were pivotal in developing firmware, enhancing print quality, and upgrading the Zeta model for 4K capabilities.
        </p>

        <!-- My Role and Contributions -->
        <h3>My Role and Contributions</h3>
        <p>
          My primary responsibility involved writing low-level firmware in Embedded C to control essential components, including stepper motors for multi-axis control, laser distance sensors, door sensors, and aesthetic LEDs for user feedback. The firmware was designed to support complex multitasking, allowing synchronous operation of various components without blocking tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created a custom serial command system to receive commands from a Linux-based control system, developed in Qt (C++), and displayed on a touchscreen UI. This system allowed efficient communication between the embedded firmware and control software, significantly enhancing user interaction and control over the printing process.
        </p>

        <!-- Print Quality Enhancement -->
        <h3>Enhancing Print Quality</h3>
        <p>
          I implemented image processing techniques to minimize visible lines on fine prints, providing a smoother surface finish. This was achieved by processing the projected images, allowing the UV LED projector to display refined images that improved print resolution. Additionally, I addressed tuning issues reported by international clients, optimizing the firmware in response to feedback.
        </p>

        <!-- Zeta 4K Upgrade and Client Support -->
        <h3>Zeta 4K Upgrade and Client Support</h3>
        <p>
          With the release of the Zeta 4K model, I developed firmware to interface with a 4K UV LED Projector, allowing higher-resolution prints due to the increased pixel density. During my time, a Zeta 4K unit was shipped to a client in China, and I was responsible for resolving any bugs, including an issue where the printer wouldnâ€™t immediately accept new parameter settings. I scheduled and led meetings with the client, pushing remote firmware updates as needed.
        </p>

        <!-- Linux Executables in Qt -->
        <h3>Developing Linux Executables in Qt</h3>
        <p>
          I created production-ready Linux executables for the Zeta control software using Qt and CMake, packaging the software and dependencies into a single executable for efficient deployment. This approach streamlined the installation process and ensured compatibility with the client's systems.
